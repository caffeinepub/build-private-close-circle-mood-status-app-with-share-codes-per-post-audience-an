  "summary": "CloseCircle will transition circle membership from one-sided (stored only under the owner) to a two-sided model by adding mirrored member→circles storage. Rollout will be gradual, starting with a backend-only storage change (no UI yet), with later planned member-side surfaces like “circles I’m in”, “people who have me in their circle”, a lightweight private relationship viewer, and smarter Safe People suggestions derived from existing relationship/interaction data.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Frontend is a React SPA using TanStack Router for routing and TanStack React Query for caching, polling, mutations, and cache invalidation.",
    "Authentication is handled via Internet Identity (@dfinity/auth-client) with a context provider exposing login/logout and granular status flags.",
    "Backend access uses a typed canister actor created by useActor; actor instances are keyed by principal and trigger broad query invalidation/refetch when identity changes.",
    "Motoko backend uses a mixin-based RBAC layer (AccessControl + MixinAuthorization) to gate canister methods by role.",
    "Near-real-time updates are implemented via polling (feed ~30s, notifications ~15s) plus manual refresh on the feed.",
    "UI is composed with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui primitives + lucide-react icons; next-themes provides light/dark theme support.",
    "Privacy enforcement is primarily server-side (per-post audience checks; contextTags sanitized for non-authors) with additional defensive UI choices (e.g., never rendering contextTags).",
    "Client-side insights (mood analyzer, mood history, circle energy) are derived from cached feed data and update automatically as queries refresh.",
    "Journal functionality is implemented as a global Sheet overlay controlled via React context to allow opening from multiple app surfaces.",
    "Sensitive bootstrap secrets (admin token) are read from the URL hash and persisted in sessionStorage to reduce accidental leakage from query strings."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Backend generateRandomShareCode() is deterministic (index mod 36), making server-generated share codes predictable and potentially collision-prone if empty codes are allowed.",
    "Backend createOrUpdateJournalEntry() uses Time.now() as the entry “date” key and filters by exact equality, so repeated saves won’t reliably update/replace same-day entries; backend also doesn’t enforce the UI rule that past days are locked.",
    "Multiple frontend paths convert bigint nanosecond timestamps to Number for sorting/date-fns, risking precision loss and subtle ordering/time display issues.",
    "Share code updates do not purge stale join-request records keyed by the previous share code, despite UI copy implying pending requests are invalidated.",
    "Canister state is stored in non-stable variables (Map/List) with no upgrade persistence shown; data may be lost on canister upgrades.",
    "Circle membership is stored only under the circle owner principal (one-sided), limiting member-centric features unless mirrored state is added.",
    "Deployment: build/deploy pipeline encountered an unspecified deployment error during push to the network. Needs error details/log capture to diagnose.",
    "Logout does not consistently redirect users away from authenticated-only routes; after logout, protected pages can still render a logged-in-only error state instead of returning to the public homepage.",
    "UI layout: Fixed bottom footer/bottom bar overlaps page body content across multiple screens. Footer should remain fixed/visible, but scrollable page content must include sufficient bottom safe-area/padding so key controls (e.g., Check-In “Share” button) are never hidden; button does not need to be sticky.",
    "Profile update currently overwrites creation date (createdAt); backend should preserve original createdAt and ignore any client-supplied createdAt during updates."
