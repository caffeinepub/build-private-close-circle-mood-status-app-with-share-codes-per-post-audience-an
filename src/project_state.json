  "summary": "CloseCircle focuses on a private daily check‑in that reduces thinking and increases guidance. Foundation promise/boundary copy is integrated across key surfaces; mood language preserves user agency (no auto-suggested feelings). Mood Analyzer is actionable via conservative, rule‑based micro‑actions (≤2 minutes). Circles are day‑to‑day useful without social pressure via global Safe People (1–2) and Silent Signals (no notifications). UI direction includes an expressive neon/tech palette (light + dark) with strong mood-based colors and a Gen‑Z, text‑light pass using progressive disclosure and more visual communication.",

    "Frontend is a React SPA using TanStack Router for routing and TanStack React Query for caching, polling, mutations, and cache invalidation.",
    "Authentication is handled via Internet Identity (@dfinity/auth-client) with a context provider exposing login/logout and granular status flags.",
    "Backend access uses a typed canister actor created by useActor; actor instances are keyed by principal and trigger broad query invalidation/refetch when identity changes.",
    "Motoko backend uses a mixin-based RBAC layer (AccessControl + MixinAuthorization) to gate canister methods by role.",
    "Near-real-time updates are implemented via polling (feed ~30s, notifications ~15s) plus manual refresh on the feed.",
    "UI is composed with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui primitives + lucide-react icons; next-themes provides light/dark theme support.",
    "Privacy enforcement is primarily server-side (per-post audience checks; contextTags sanitized for non-authors) with additional defensive UI choices (e.g., never rendering contextTags).",
    "Client-side insights (mood analyzer, mood history, circle energy) are derived from cached feed data and update automatically as queries refresh.",
    "Journal functionality is implemented as a global Sheet overlay controlled via React context to allow opening from multiple app surfaces.",
    "Sensitive bootstrap secrets (admin token) are read from the URL hash and persisted in sessionStorage to reduce accidental leakage from query strings."

  "known_issues": [
    "Backend generateRandomShareCode() is deterministic (index mod 36), making server-generated share codes predictable and potentially collision-prone if empty codes are allowed.",
    "Backend createOrUpdateJournalEntry() uses Time.now() as the entry “date” key and filters by exact equality, so repeated saves won’t reliably update/replace same-day entries; backend also doesn’t enforce the UI rule that past days are locked.",
    "useActor always calls _initializeAccessControlWithSecret() for authenticated users; if CAFFEINE_ADMIN_TOKEN is not set in the canister environment, the canister traps and the app cannot proceed.",
    "Multiple frontend paths convert bigint nanosecond timestamps to Number for sorting/date-fns, risking precision loss and subtle ordering/time display issues.",
    "Backend joinCircleFromShareCode() notification message uses the target (circle owner) profile name as the requester name, producing misleading notifications.",
    "Backend updateProfile() overwrites createdAt with Time.now(), losing original profile creation timestamp semantics even if the client supplies createdAt.",
    "Share code updates do not purge stale join-request records keyed by the previous share code, despite UI copy implying pending requests are invalidated.",
    "Canister state is stored in non-stable variables (Map/List) with no upgrade persistence shown; data may be lost on canister upgrades.",
    "Circle membership is stored only under the circle owner principal (one-sided), limiting member-centric features unless mirrored state is added.",
    "urlParams clearParamFromHash() only removes params from hash routes that include a '?' query segment; for simple '#token=value' style hashes, secrets may remain in the URL/history after extraction."
