# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the public login screen copy and rebrand the app name from “Inner Circle” to “CloseCircle” across the frontend UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the public login/home auth button text to a calmer, more emotional phrase centered on “Log in”, and ensure the in-progress/loading label uses consistent wording.
- Replace all user-facing instances of the app name text “Inner Circle” with “CloseCircle” throughout the frontend (including login screen branding and the authenticated header).

**User-visible outcome:** Users see the updated, calmer “Log in” button copy (including matching loading text) and the app is consistently branded as “CloseCircle” everywhere in the UI.
