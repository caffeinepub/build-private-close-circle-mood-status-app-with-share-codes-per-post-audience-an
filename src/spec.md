# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display a bell icon next to each circle member’s name in the Circle page Members tab.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Circle Members list row UI to render a bell icon visually adjacent to each listed member’s display name (for members shown in the existing `otherMembers` list).
- Ensure the existing member row content (name, optional age, pulse badge, remove-member control) continues to render and behave as before.

**User-visible outcome:** In the Circle page (Members tab), each listed member (excluding the current user per existing filtering) shows a bell icon next to their name.
