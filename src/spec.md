# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update all user-facing language to avoid implied mood/emotion inference, keeping wording agency-preserving and based only on what users selected or posted.

**Planned changes:**
- Audit and revise frontend UI copy so it never claims or implies the app “knows,” “detects,” or “infers” how the user or their circle feels; rewrite summaries to reference selected moods, entries, and posting trends.
- Update Mood Analyzer UI copy and generated guidance text to describe distributions/trends of selected moods (non-clinical, non-diagnostic phrasing), including the 0-entries empty state.
- Ensure mood picker and check-in/compose/reminder surfaces remain fully user-chosen: no default mood selection, no suggested mood language, and surrounding copy reinforces user choice.
- Update Circle Energy generated summary templates to avoid “feels” language and instead describe patterns observed in posts over the last week.
- Update login/onboarding/product copy to emphasize private sharing and user-chosen selections (calm tone), without “share your feelings” or interpretation-implying language.

**User-visible outcome:** The app’s mood-related and onboarding text consistently frames insights as patterns from the user’s selections/posts, avoids clinical or diagnostic framing, and reinforces that moods are always explicitly chosen by the user.
