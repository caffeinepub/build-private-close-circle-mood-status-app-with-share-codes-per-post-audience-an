# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the post-login footer attribution and reposition author attribution as subtle text on the login screen.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the existing footer attribution block from the authenticated app layout so it no longer renders (including removing the “Powered by Internet Computer” text and ICP logo from the UI footer area).
- Add a small, muted attribution line reading exactly “Built by Abel Odoh” directly under the “CloseCircle” logo/title on the login screen.

**User-visible outcome:** After login, no attribution/footer credit (including “Powered by Internet Computer” and the ICP logo) appears at the bottom of the app; on the login screen, “Built by Abel Odoh” appears subtly under the CloseCircle title.
