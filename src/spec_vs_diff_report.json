  "summary": "The diff implements removal of the romantic/friendship onboarding step, adds a safe default `RelationshipIntent.friendship` for new profiles while still sending required backend fields, and removes the “Looking For” section from the Profile page while preserving/sending the existing stored `relationshipIntent` on update. However, the diff also updates project/documentation summary files to describe multiple unrelated UI/routing/features that were not requested in this BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "These features are not requested by REQ-52/REQ-53/REQ-54 (which are limited to removing the intent question from onboarding and profile UI while preserving backend-required fields).
