  "summary": "Implemented new branding constant (CloseCircle) and updated login/auth button copy and loading label; updated app header to display new app name via shared constant. Also introduced additional login screen copy/UI content beyond the requested text changes.",

    {
      "description": "Expanded/rewrote the login screen UI and supporting marketing copy beyond just changing the auth button label and app name (e.g., added Welcome card, privacy/trusted-circle highlight sections, new tagline, and additional consent text).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked to (1) change the login button text + loading label consistency and (2) replace the app name text occurrences; it did not request broader login screen content/layout changes.",
