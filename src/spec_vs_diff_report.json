  "summary": "REQ-12 appears implemented by removing the footer component from the authenticated AppLayout so no footer attribution can render. REQ-13 appears implemented by adding a small muted “Built by Abel Odoh” line directly under the “CloseCircle” (APP_NAME) title on the login screen. The diff also introduces at least one unrelated change (SoundEffectsManager added to AppLayout) that was not requested.",
