  "summary": "The diff touches the Circle members list component, but the provided truncated excerpt does not clearly show removal of the relationship intent text/badge. Additionally, two modified meta/documentation files introduce unrelated feature descriptions (routes, onboarding/profile intent changes, backend model rollout notes) that are outside the requested scope.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-55",
      "requirement": "In the Circle page’s Members tab, stop displaying each member’s relationship intent (romantic/friendship/both) in the members list UI.",
      "reason": "The only relevant UI file shown (CircleMembersList.tsx) is truncated before any area where relationship intent might be rendered, so the diff summary does not provide evidence that intent text/badges were removed from member rows.",

      "requirement": "Frontend TypeScript build passes without unused imports/types related to relationship intent in the members list component.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not show whether any relationship-intent-related imports/types previously used by the members list were removed (or whether any now remain unused). The shown imports do not reference relationship intent, but the excerpt is incomplete.",
